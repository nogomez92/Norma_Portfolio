# [Project One: Chicago E-Scooter EDA: Project Overview](https://github.com/nogomez92/Norma_Portfolio/blob/086dd9720b31d601c1c0e031e9d2ecb15c5b25a2/chicago-e-scooter-2022-trips-analysis.ipynb)

  Conducted an analysis to determine scooter trends in Chicago frm May 2022 to December 2022 and what neighborhoods experienced the highest and lowest scooter usage. Worked indeipendently for 2 weeks to extract, clean, analyze and visualize Chicago scooter data. This project was completed in Python and a choropleth map. Usage follows a seasonal trend, where we see an increase in number of rides in early summer to early fall and then a steady decline through the end of year. Results found that scooter riders use scooters for short (9 min distances/1 mile) usually in the early evening and more often in centralized neighborhoods. This study could be improved upon by also aggregating 2019 and 2020 data to further analyze changing patterns in scooter usage by neighborhood.
